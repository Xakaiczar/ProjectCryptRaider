# Project "Crypt Raider"
_Developed with Unreal Engine 5_

**DISCLAIMER**: This project is based heavily on "Crypt Raider", the third module of "Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer: Learn C++ & Make Video Games" by GamedevTV. Most of the code will have been written and designed by me, and it may differ significantly as I diverge from the lecturer to solve the problem myself. However, all work here is inspired by - and heavily derivative of - work that is not my own, therefore this project is not my own and cannot be distributed. This project is for assessment by prospective employers only.

# About the Project
